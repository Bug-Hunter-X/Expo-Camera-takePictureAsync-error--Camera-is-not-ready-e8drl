# Expo Camera takePictureAsync Error: Camera is not ready

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API's `takePictureAsync` method. The error, "Camera is not ready," arises when attempting to capture an image before the camera component has fully initialized.

## Problem

The `takePictureAsync` method is called prematurely within a component's lifecycle, resulting in the error. This typically occurs when the method is invoked within the `useEffect` hook without sufficient asynchronous handling to ensure camera readiness.

## Solution

This issue is addressed by ensuring the `takePictureAsync` method is called only after the camera component has successfully initialized. This is achieved by using the `cameraRef` object's `current` property to check for camera readiness.
